# 🪙 Treza Token (TREZA)

## Overview

Treza Token (`TREZA`) is a custom ERC20 token with built-in transfer fees and vesting functionality, designed to support sustainable treasury growth and fair contributor rewards. This implementation provides two core components:

- **TrezaToken.sol** — An ERC20 token with a dynamic transfer fee routed to a treasury wallet.
- **TokenVesting.sol** — A linear vesting contract with a 6-month cliff, allowing deferred token releases for contributors or advisors.
